## Features

### View Submissions

- Clicking on **View Submissions** opens a form where users can navigate through all submitted entries.
- Navigation is facilitated through **Previous** and **Next** buttons or using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + P for Previous and Ctrl + N for Next).
- Each submission displays details such as Name, Email, Phone Number, GitHub repo link, and Stopwatch time.

### Create New Submission

- Clicking on **Create New Submission** opens a form where users can enter new submission details.
- Fields include Name, Email, Phone Number, GitHub repo link, and a Stopwatch that can be toggled between Start, Pause, and Resume states.
- Users can submit the form either by clicking the **Submit** button or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + S).

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl + P**: Navigate to the previous submission.
- **Ctrl + N**: Navigate to the next submission.
- **Ctrl + S**: Submit the form when creating a new submission.
- **Ctrl + T**: Toggle the stopwatch state (Start, Pause, Resume) when creating a new submission.
